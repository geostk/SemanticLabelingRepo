2708 1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:brJanuary 14th/Sunday eve--/brDear Miss Breed,/Thank you ever so much for your lovely card and hankie. I dont know how to apologize for not sending you a Christmas card or greetings. I left most of my Christmas shopping to the last minute and then three days before Christmas that nasty cold caught up with me and put me into bed. That is my sad sad story. However, there was a bright side to Christmas--my brother came from Milwaukee to visit us./Were all very proud of him, and were certainly glad to see him. He has now graduated from Marquette, and at the present time is trying his hardest to get into Med School there. He was indeed lucky to be asked to join an honorary Biology fraternity--Ive forgotten the name. It seems that Niseis are not accepted at Marquette Med School, but my brother feels that he may be able to break the ice. At least he is trying--we will know in about three or four weeks definitly whether or not he will be accepted./I should like to tell you some very pleasant news--my sister and Bill are going to have a blessed event some time in May or June. Were all very happy in anticipation--but I think Bill is most excited. My mother is planning to come out in May, which we are eagerly anticipating. Incidentally, my father wrote that at the Canteen raffle in Crystal City my mother won a suitcase and is planning to come up with it. It makes a very good prize, doesnt it? The way my wrote it was so cute it makes me laugh just thinking about it./Last Friday night my girlfriend gave me one of these so called home permanents. All her previous ones were successful--but mine was an utter flop When we rinsed it--it was absolutely straight It makes me laugh just to think about it Ill have to make an appointment at some beauty shop and get a genuine one. This will cost me more money in the long run/The news of being able to go back to California has been accepted with mingled feeling. First of all were more than glad that the ban has been lifted, as it rightfully should be. Those with property are wanting to go back, but wondering how the sentiment will be. Of course we know that good friends like you would be glad to have us back but others who do not know us or understand us may not be as glad to see us. As for us who are not so fortunate to have property in California--were content to stay here for a while or maybe the rest of our life, but well make a point of seeing and visiting California later. My first ambition upon getting back to San Diego is to see you./ Well, this will be all for now. But may I wish you a happy New Year and hope youll write when you have time./Sincerely/Fusa

Again it rained instead of really snowing. At least the tiny snowflakes were dry for a few minutes before the rain. We are hoping to run into snowfall on the way home. /Dad is working in the barber shop now. Yaeko writes that she is now out on indefinite leave in Preston, Idaho. She plans to visit Poston sometime soon. /The other day the kitchen crew went on a tour of the farm since we had not been able to go out since we worked all day. The farm is really huge. The soil is soft and black. The tremendous flocks of geese have done the soil such good. However they trampled the grain and ate the greens. We saw the Tule Lake. It is beautiful. Made me homesick for S.D. It looked as if we were looking out toward the sea./Thanks again for the road map. Now we can really see where we are going. It surprised us last night to see just how far we had gone and where we were./The letters were really welcome. Now I know how soldiers feel about mail. We certainly crowded around when mail was issued. The joy of receiving and the disappointment of not receiving. Mail was food for morale. /Sincerely,/Ted/P.S.

3981 1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:brNovember 11, 1942/Dear Miss McNary,/This is Louise who is getting blacker and blacker by the minute in sunny Arizona. Since the last time I wrote nothing exciting has occurred. We are all fine and I hope you will receive this letter in the best of health too./Saturday, Nov. 7th, I experienced something I shall never forget. I went cotton picking with my school-mates to raise funds so the school will be able to have a school paper. We left home at 8:30 A.M. on a cattle truck. We were going bumpity bump down the narrow dirt road when all of a sudden we came to a halt. We quickly jumped to our feet and saw a little house. In it sat a military police who counted us like cattles. Then we were again winding through the Mosquite trees until finally we were surrounded by cotton plants. We all cried, Well, here we are--lets get busy After piling out of the truck like ants, we were given a large sack in which to put the cotton. This bag was very very long. It weighed 2 lbs and often got in our way. We flung the bag over our left shoulder and began picking the cotton. It certainly was a good thing that I wore slacks and a long sleeve blouse for you get scratched all over. I often crawled on the ground to pick the fallen cottons. I picked the long staple cotton./A.--long staple cotton--small cotton which is hard to pick--the price is 4 c. a lb./B.--short staple cotton--large cotton which is much easier to pick but the price is 1 c. a lb./I hate to mention how much I picked but Ill be bold and tell you. But before I do promise me you wont laugh I picked only 14 lbs. Now, isnt that sad? I only made 56 c. for the school. But when you add up all the students who picked 14 lbs. I guess the amount will be much greater. If I ever have a chance to go again Ill try to pick much more. At least this time Ill know how to go about it. You see, we were given no instructions as to how we should pick it. We were told to pick everything that was white either on the plants or on the ground./Cotton picking certainly is a boring job. It is no wonder that the negroes have developed such a talent in singing. But I enjoyed it tremendously. We also sang songs and cracked jokes while working./Do you remember Emi Himaka and Kikuye Kawamoto (one of the twins)? Well, in the morning Emi picked 4 lbs. and Kikuye picked 5 lbs. and I picked 6 lbs. But my other friend who is formerly from Visalia picked 8 lbs. Then in the afternoon Emi, Kikuye, and I together picked 18 lbs. We put all the cotton together in one bag. Emi carried the bag. Emi and I had to carry the bag together to take it to be weighed. We didnt expect it to weigh 18 lbs. Even though we didnt accomplish as much as we would have liked to we had a great deal of enjoyment./We stopped work about 4:30 P.M. and were taken to the trading post which is about 8 miles on this side of Parker. The trading post was one of thise country stores where they sold from shoes to food. There were many Indians there. That is where they do their shopping./One thing I missed was water. It was like being in the middle of a desert. When we arrived at the trading post, we ran in the store expecting to buy a soda. But to our disappointment no cold drinks were sold. Even though I had no water and came home exhausted I enjoyed every minute of it. It certainly felt good to get home/Today all the elderly people and invalids received a mattress. My father received one but Im still a spring chicken so the straw mattress is good enough for me/Oh by the way, this is how I looked when I went cotton picking: [drawing] Please use your imagination for itll help alot./brI have heard linoleums are going to be laid on the mess hall floors. I think this is wonderful/Since school began the first school affair was the Junior Jubilee. It was a social put on by the Junior class. It was very successful. The seniors are planning to have a social too. I hope this w

Without the dust and heat I could not complain about Poston./I have been working as a waitress for two weeks now and find it fun. Eleven other girls my age and over are working with me--all whom I know so we get along quite well together. /In the morning we serve coffee to the adults and coffee to the children. For dinner and supper we have ice water which is delicious because of the warm weather. Our food is much better than Santa Anita and we have more varieties. Breakfast is from 7:00 to 7:30; dinner is from 12:00 to 12:30; supper is from 5:30 to 6:00. /Next month school is going to start for students who are under 18 years of age. It is really going to be a joy getting back to school with Caucasian teachers. This is going to be a regular school and we are going to get credit for attending. I am privileged to have such an opportunity as I have only a year before I will graduate High School./Florence wants to write to you. /THANK YOU FOR THE CANDY, MISS BREED. HELLO MISS MCNARY.
